# Why I Built The Bench

Three months ago, I had nearly no practical development experience. Just school grades, research papers, and countless hours grinding LeetCode problems. So when someone reached out on LinkedIn about leading technical development for an ambitious project, my first instinct was skepticism (probably another course seller or crypto scheme). But I was hungry for real-world experience, something that would finally let me apply everything I'd been learning in theory.

That's how I discovered the vision behind The Bench: a Canadian University Sports Fantasy Website designed to revolutionize how students engage with USports. For someone passionate about both sports and machine learning, it was the perfect opportunity.

## Identifying the Gap

Sports have shaped my entire life. From grassroots soccer to competing at the national level, I've experienced firsthand how energized crowds can transform games for both players and fans. I've witnessed the incredible energy of college sports culture in the US and seen how passionate Canadian fans rally behind our professional teams. 

But here's what bothers me: Canadians are sports-obsessed, and students are some of the most passionate fans you'll find, yet our university athletics fade into the background. As a statistics and computer science student, I realized I had the exact skills needed to change that. This wasn't just another portfolio project. This was a chance to give students a personal stake in their school teams, using data and fantasy engagement to fuel the kind of rivalries and school spirit that make sports memorable.

## Technical Learning Objectives

What excites me most about this project is that I found something at the intersection of my two biggest interests. I broke the project into three core areas that aligned with what I wanted to master:

**Data Pipeline:** Building Python scrapers with Beautiful Soup to extract USports basketball stats, then processing everything with Pandas and NumPy to generate advanced metrics and machine learning-ready datasets.

**Full Stack Development:** After researching modern tech stacks, I implemented Next.js with Supabase for authentication and databases, deployed through Vercel. The foundation is set, and now I'm expanding the core features.

**Machine Learning:** Experimenting in TensorFlow and Google Colab to predict player performance, starting with minutes played as a gateway to modeling more complex statistics and generating fair odds.

I've had to adapt constantly, learning new frameworks faster than I thought possible, pivoting when approaches don't work, and finding creative solutions to unfamiliar problems. That's exactly what I love about building something real.

## Looking Forward

Three months in, this project is nowhere near complete, but I'm more motivated than when I started. What drives me isn't just the technical growth. It's the vision of Canadian students actually engaging with their school sporting events and building that enthusiastic community we see elsewhere.

I'm working alongside friends and fellow passionate sports fans who share this vision, and together we're creating something that could genuinely impact how university sports are experienced in Canada. Even if we don't spark a complete transformation, this project has already demonstrated something important: I get genuinely excited by ambitious ideas that others might call unrealistic, I love building solutions for real people, and I believe the best projects happen when your interests drive the development process.

The goal is to bridge the gap between Canada's love for sports and our underappreciated university athletics. Whether or not we change the entire landscape, I know I'm where I want to be: building something meaningful, learning constantly, and proving that the most rewarding projects come from combining technical skills with problems you actually care about solving.

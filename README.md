## About This Project

This is a portfolio demonstration project showcasing advanced web development skills and my passion for Canadian university sports. The platform features a complete authentication system and betting interface, designed to match the quality of professional sports betting applications.

## Current Status

**Completed Core Systems:**
- Complete user authentication (signup, login, email confirmation, password reset)
- User profile management and account settings
- Responsive betting interface with shopping cart functionality

- Professional UI matching industry standards (DraftKings/FanDuel quality)

**Development Phase - Mock Data:**
- The betting system uses placeholder data for demonstration purposes
- Player names, odds, and game data are mock implementations
- This allows showcasing the complete user experience while development continues

**Planned Implementations:**
- Real sports data integration via APIs
- Machine learning models for odds calculation and predictions
- Live betting with real-time updates
- Multi-sport expansion beyond basketball
- Stripe payment implementaion
